## About
Chungusware was originally created in late 2020

## Installation
Use gradle to build the jar (or download it from the releases)

### Setup
You can use MultiMC to use this mod similar to how you would OptiFine

## Usage
A TabGUI would go against the vision of Chungusware. Modules have keybinds hardcoded, and the ones that do not can be toggled with the `.toggle [Module]` command. ðŸ’ª 

## How Do You Decide What Modules To Implement
We don't add sorry features (Fly, KillAura, NoFall, etc.) because they go against the vision of Chungusware

## i want the color of my screen to be slightly more warm and saturated
Run `.t shader`
